# Introduction

## What is Siterack?
**Siterack is a management tool for WordPress websites, designed for use by freelance developers, digitial agencies, and hosting companies.**

We built Siterack to simplify and automate the redundant, time-consuming tasks involved in professional website management.  

We offer two versions of Siterack:
-  **Developer**, for small agencies and developers who manage up to 25 sites. 
-  **Enterprise**, for large agencies and hosting companies who need a scaleable solution. 

<!-- I have recorded a quick demo to show some of the features on Cronhub.

<!-- ## Developer
Siterack Developer combines all of the Siterack features into a manageable system that is easily operated by a single individual. However, because of the team feature, it is possible to have multiple members accessing and managing the sites associated with the account. 

The team feature can be used as a method for client colaboration
