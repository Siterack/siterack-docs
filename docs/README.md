## What is SiteRack?
**SiteRack is a management tool for WordPress websites, designed for use by WebPros with clients, digitial agencies, and anyone managing their personal or business WordPress website.**

We built SiteRack to simplify and automate the redundant, time-consuming tasks involved in professional WordPress website management.  

We offer two versions of SiteRack:
-  **WebPro** - For web professionals and digital agencies that just need the SiteRack tool to manage unlimited WordPress websites. 
-  **Managed** - For web professionals and digital agencies who are looking for a managed solution to do all of what WebPro offers plus SiteRack provides the advanced web hosting and technical support.

<!-- ## Developer
Siterack Developer combines all of the Siterack features into a manageable system that is easily operated by a single individual. However, because of the team feature, it is possible to have multiple members accessing and managing the sites associated with the account. 

The team feature can be used as a method for client colaboration
